# Explainable AI for Hate Speech Detection

This repository contains my work on explainable AI techniques for hate speech detection in Portuguese text.

## Overview
I'm exploring how LIME and SHAP can help explain machine learning models that detect hate speech, with a focus on Brazilian Portuguese social media data.

## Files
- `deepxplain-notes.md` - Research notes, definitions, and reflections
- `results.csv` - Analysis results and model outputs
- `sentiment_analysis_preproc.py` - Code for preprocessing the dataset before sentiment analysis
- `foxready_sentiment_analysis_training.py` - Code for sentiment analysis
- `Limeshap.py` - Code for implementing LIME and SHAP

## Current Status
Successfully implemented LIME for model explanation. SHAP had technical issues with Portuguese BERT tokenization.
